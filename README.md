## OutswapV1

OutswapV1 is built on UniswapV2 and incorporates Blast (Layer 2) localization improvements as well as enhancements to liquidity provision fee management.

OutswapV1 uses RETH and RUSD from Outstake as the base tokens for exchange. On OutswapV1, all activities related to ETH and USDB will use RETH and RUSD as intermediary tokens. Therefore, Outstake will capture the native yields generated by OutswapV1.

Unlike UniswapV2, where liquidity providers only receive LP fees when removing liquidity, with the fees being included in the liquidity removed, OutswapV1 separates liquidity from LP fees. Users can claim fees separately without removing liquidity, allowing for better position management. This also aligns with our FFLaunch product, as detailed in the FFLaunch documentation.

In the near future, we will also upgrade OutswapV1 to improve capital efficiency and reduce slippage, providing users with a smoother experience.
